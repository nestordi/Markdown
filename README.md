|                             | **World Bank Oct 14 Info.**                   | **IMF Jan 15 Info.** |
| -------------               |-------------                            |      -----|
| **Do well**                     |•The chart is multidimensional. It explores data in high level (line chart) and drill down (bar char).   | •Bar charts divided by category gives a quick idea of the status of each economy. |
|                             |•Different bars charts are aligned and using the same axis. This helps when comparing values. Negative values are appreciated immediately.                                  |•It gives explanation about the data using text and images. |
|                    |                                   |   |
| **Do poorly**                   |•There are few variables in the infographic.                                  |•Not very original. Lack of density. |
|                  |•Descriptive diagram (3 trends) seems to be the focus of the infographic, taking about 30% of the page.                                  |•Few variables in the infographic. |
|                    |•The use of the same colors for different purposes may confuse the reader.                                  |•Some images don’t seem to have a clear purpose in the infographic.  |
|                  |                                   |•Lack of dimensionality, there is nothing to explore beside the bar charts. |
|                  |                                   |     |
| **Suggestions**                   |•Include more variables in the analysis.                                  |•Include more variables in the analysis. |
|                  |•Reduce the amount of color with no relevance to avoid confusion.                                   |    •Include comparison with the data. |
|                  |                                   |•Reduce the amount of images with no relevance. |
